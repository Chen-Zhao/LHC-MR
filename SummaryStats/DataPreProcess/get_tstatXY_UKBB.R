### Script to obtain the SNPs for which we had LD and regression weight calculation from UKBiobank summary statistics only!

#LD scores and regression weights found in this file were computed based on 3781 individuals from the UK10K study.
#For the LD score calculation, squared correlations were computed between the target SNP and all sequence variants within its 2 Mb neighbourhood 
#with MAF>=0.5 (in the UK10K). For the regression weight calculation, we restricted the neighbouring variants to those part of the 4'650'107 well-imputed SNPs.

## Extract SNPs high-quality SNPs, defined as being present in both UK10K and UK Biobank, having MAF>1 in both data sets, 
#info>0.99 in the UK Biobank, non-significant (P_{diff}>0.05) allele frequency difference between UK Biobank and UK10K and 
#residing outside the HLA region (chr6:28.5-33.5Mb)
