# LHC-MR

Latent Heritable Confounder MR (LHC-MR) is a method applicable to association summary statistics, which estimates bi-directional causal effects, direct heritability, confounder effects and sample overlap. 

LHC-MR extends the standard Mendelian Randomisation model to incorporate the presence of a latent (unmeasured) heritable confounder and estimates its contribution to the exposure and outcome traits, while simultaneously estimating the bi-directional causal effect between the two traits.
