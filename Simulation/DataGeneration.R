### Generating N different data sets to be used in LHC-MR and standard MR methods
# This is to avoid having to repeat the data generation process each time a new method is to be compared
# A seed is set to generate the different data, they are saved in their respective folders (named after the seeting) 
# under a subfloder called Data
# Need to source DataSim, set up the parameters for that specific setting and generate data N times (100 usually)
